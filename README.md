## Course Overview

The Kaggle Intro to Machine Learning course provides a **structured introduction** to machine learning for beginners. Through interactive exercises, learners gain practical experience in:

- Understanding **supervised and unsupervised learning**  
- Evaluating models using metrics like **accuracy, F1-score, and cross-validation**  
- Performing **feature engineering** and **data preprocessing**  
- Implementing algorithms such as **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors**  
- Handling **missing values**, categorical data, and feature scaling  
- Identifying and addressing **overfitting and underfitting**  
- Performing **clustering** and exploratory data analysis  

The course emphasizes **hands-on application**, allowing learners to develop **practical skills** by working on Kaggle datasets and implementing ML workflows end-to-end.
